# Working with SQL(Structured Query Language)
[SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page) is one of the few resources online that actually lets you build and run queries against existing tables. 
Each section will show you a table and then have you run queries against it to answer specific questions. 

The aim of this project is to demonstrate some Advanced SQL concepts adopted in Real-world projects
This project was completed in line with standards provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
